What will become of me fron now on?
After somet ime, I stopped thinking about that.
Maybe I forgot...
how to think at all.
Nothing changes anymore.
This world that belongs only to me,
each and every day, continues on.
But I'm not lonely.
It doesn't bother me at all.

I could never find the right way to tell you,
have you noticed I've been gone?

Because I left behind teh home that you made me,
but I will carry it along.

Mm, it's a long way forward,
so trust in me.
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me,
and I know I'm not alone,
you'll be watching over us.
Until you're gone.

Whe I'm older I'll be silent beside you,
I know words won't be enough.
And they won't need to know our names or our faces,
but they will carry on for us.

Mm, it's a long way forward,
so trust in me.
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me,
and I know I'm not alone.
you'll be watching over us.
Until you're gone.

Even if those memories make me sad,
I've got to go forward, believing in the future.
Even when I realize my loneliness
and am about to lose all hope,
those memories make me stronger.
I'm not alone...
because of you.
Thank you.
